# Consnake
Have you ever seen a novice dev cook up the tradition portion of the classic snake game? Well, here I deliver you another serving of exactly that. 
Consnake is the console version of the famous snake game with simple rules: move, eat, grow... and don't crash.

## How to play
- Used the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to control the movement of Consnake
- Aim to consume the food randomly spawned across the arena to up your Consnake's size
- Be mindful as the Consnake grows, avoiding colliding with the arena's borders... or your own body
